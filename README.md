## Priorities and Values for this site

###### The basic priorities of this site reflect my personal values for coding best practices, namely:

1. Accessibility
  - This site uses agreed-upon tenets of accessible web design as the core design principles. The basic principles used here come from Web Accessibility in Mind (WebAIM) and Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). These can be summarized using the acronym __POUR__:
    - **Perceivable** (especially to those with limited visual or auditory faculties)
    - **Operable** (for example, fully navigable without a mouse for those with limited motor skills)
    - **Understandable** (all content easily legible and comprehensible to as wide a variety of users as possible)
    - **Robust** (using widely-accepted tools to allow easy future compatibility)
  - For more information on these principles, see the resources listed under Accessibility in Sources at the end of the README. For the full list of specific web design principles I am aiming toward in this site, see specifically http://webaim.org/intro/#principles.
2. Diversity and Inclusion
  - Arguably a superset of accessibility, diversity in users can only exist when accessibility has been made a priority. Every failure to make a site accessible automatically limits the diversity of its visitor or user base. But above and beyond diversity of users, this site prioritizes diversity of ideas and diversity of tools.
  **EXAMPLES? MORE? ALREADY TOO MUCH?**
3. Research / Continuous Learning
  - This README should already indicate that I am invested in doing research so that I can find and share good resources and ideas. As a former teacher and academic, I care deeply about developing rigorous intellectual underpinnings for my projects. I also think that by constantly experimenting with new ways of doing things and new tools, we have a much better chance of finding the best tool to solve a given problem. 
  - One good model for describing the model I aspire to is Carol Dweck's work on the 'growth mindset.' According to Dweck, 'growth mindset' is the belief that ability can be learned, rather than being innate. Someone who embraces this mindset in a certain aspect of life will be more likely to:
    - Keep trying in the face of difficulty, instead of giving up
    - Accept and learn from mistakes
    - Listen to and incorporate negative or critical feedback
    - Be inspired by the success of others and push themselves harder as a result
  - The most obvious outlet for continuous learning on this site is the blog, where I will post new things I learn and new tools I've discovered, but the site itself reflects the desire to use a variety of tools and approaches to solving problems, even within the structure of a given website. **EXAMPLES?**
